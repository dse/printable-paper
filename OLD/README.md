# printable-paper

A program and set of Perl modules that can produce almost any kind of
printable ruled and grid paper.  Lines and grids can be dotted or
dashed.

This package specializes in regular series of lines (or dots).  It
does not produce non-right angles, logarithmic, isometric, polar, or
other fancy stuff.

Features include:

-   SVG, PDF, and PostScript output formats.

-   Metric and US/Imperial paper sizes.

-   Two-page output files are supported for double-sided printing,
    flip on long edge.

-   2-up and 4-up printing.  Typical use cases:

    |output paper size    |2-up: cut in half cross-wise for:|4-up: cut in quarters for:     |
