# printable-paper

Some different types of printable lined, dot grid, and grid paper, and
a Perl program that generates them.

For now this utility specializes primarily in simple series of
horizontal and vertical lines and grids for now.  No logarithmic,
isometric, polar, or other fancy stuff yet.

SVG, PDF, and PostScript formats are included.

Two-page PDF and PostScript files of all paper rulings are provided,
for convenient double-sided printing, flip on long edge.

Two-page, two-up PDF and PostScript files, printed as what are
apparently called "signatures", are also provided, for convenient
double-sided printing, flip on long edge:

    Output paper size        Cut in half cross-wise for:

    Letter (8.5in × 11in)    Half-Letter (5.5in × 8.5in)
    A4 (210mm × 297mm)       A5 (149mm × 210mm)

## Rulings Included

-   A 1/4" or 6mm dot grid.

    Index lines 5/16″ apart on letter size, 8mm apart on A4.

    extra-thinner variants.

-   A version of French ruling with major lines every three lines
    instead of four.  (Do not use for Lego bricks, as the proportions
    are not correct.)

    grid instead of solid lines.
